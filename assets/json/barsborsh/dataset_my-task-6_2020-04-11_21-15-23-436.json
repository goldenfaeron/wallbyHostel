They sent someone to fix it but we haven't seen any changes. There was no hot water in the shower. The wifi didn't work in the room either. A strong smell of fish embraced the balcony because the kitchen of the hotel was below. \nMoreover, the staff, especially one of the server (the youngest one), was constantly rude and had no sense of hospitality.",
